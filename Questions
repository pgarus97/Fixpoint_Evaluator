Questions:

Can a command start with an if clause? 
Like C = if(x<5){x=x+1}else{x=x-1} => because we dont have assigned any value to x yet, right?
so wp[C] can only be calculated in this case if if would be something like C1;C2 where C1 = x := 3 and C2 = if(x<5){x=x+1}else{x=x-1}
=> we would need a fixed variable assignment for that which is basically sigma right? Can we do that? Or is it supposed to be "open" and not defined?


Can we have multiple variables in the postexpectation?
What would C1;C2 with C1 = x:= 3 and C2 = y:=4 with f1 = x^2 and f2= x^2+y look like?
wp[C](f1) would be 9 and wp[C](f2) would be 13?

Should make this program specifically for "our" usage with the MV Algebras etc.? Because then I need to write an own Parser etc.
(Now I use a library that calculates formulas, but it does not support truncated addition and so on)

What is the end-purpose of this software? Should it be able to calculate the lower bounds of wp-while-formulas via our Upside Down technique?
Should it do so on concrete values or abstract ones? Or should it just be able to perform a couple of handpicked examples? 

Should we choose a fixed limit for the Co-Domains k & m? (not so important at the moment in the beginning)

//we want to show a candidate for a lower bound; in other words because "I" is the smallest fixpoint, does our technique work for that
smallest fixpoint?
