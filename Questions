Questions:

Can a command start with an if clause? 
Like C = if(x<5){x=x+1}else{x=x-1} => because we dont have assigned any value to x yet, correct?
so wp[C] can only be calculated in this case if if would be something like C1;C2 where C1 = x := 3 and C2 = if(x<5){x=x+1}else{x=x-1}

Can we have multiple variables in the postexpectation?
What would C1;C2 with C1 = x:= 3 and C2 = y:=4 with f1 = x^2 and f2= x^2+y look like?
wp[C](f1) would be 9 and wp[C](f2) would be 13?
