New TODO list system:

TODO:
Implement hash function + iteration
adjust GUI according to hash function calculation
allow witness input and calculation
persistent file caching of fixpoints to load / save for faster results
fix while in while non expansiveness proof
hover over buttons for full text in whileLoops
make log appear in runtime => threads? concurrency in swing
write readme with usage and documentation
Question: Dont we need to consider [not guard ] * f in Phi(X) somehow?
reset Cache button
write tests for all new methods
write systematic tests


DONE:
DONE while after while all sigma fix
DONE while in while caching
DONE while button list on select highlight selected one, as well as examine button













Obsolete:
First prototype tool that can calculate wp formulas
Results: wp(C)(f)

Inputs:
C Probabilistic Programm
f (post) expectation
k (Co-domain expectations)
m (Co-domain variables)
sigma (Var, initial state) 

Steps:
1. We need a parser  for the formula and evaluation 
(https://mathparser.org/) or check further online
<dependency>
   <groupid>org.mariuszgromada.math</groupid>
   <artifactid>MathParser.org-mXparser</artifactid>
   <version>5.0.2</version>
</dependency>


Output: Stdout (for the beginning)

2. Test formulas from presentation (perhaps limit by boolean 0,1)

3. Call again


BIG TODO:
1) DONE New Sequential System with prior parsing check 
2) New Variable System with persistent variables 
=> fix variable substitution order
=> fix variable flush for testing
=> need more concrete examples for working out the variable assignment problem
3) While Loop implementation 
4) More test cases
5) User Interface implementation


June: 
need to reimplement #{} min operator for proper 0 and k truncation
